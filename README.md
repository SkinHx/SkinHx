## Hi there 👋

## I'm a beginner in the world of programming, but as Aristotle would say "It is by doing that one learns to do what one should do". That's why I'm here to put into practice everything I'm working on:

<br/> Currently I don't work with programming, and I'm struggling to enter the market. 💻
<br/> After finishing my Front-end training, 
I will venture into the wide world of JavaScript. 🎓
<br/> Any tips? email me: eduardofroelich.dev@gmail.com, thank you! 💬
<br/> Yes, I'm writing with an English dictionary. 😂
<br/> JavaScript. ❤️
